# Keratoconus Detection Algorithm Using CNN  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based algorithm, called **KeratoDetect**, to detect and analyze keratoconus from corneal topography images.  
The model leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to assist ophthalmologists in decision-making regarding keratoconus diagnosis and surgery.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Keratoconus surgery is costly (≈ ₹45,000 per surgery).  
- Not all patients benefit equally, as improvement depends on corneal shape and eye health.  
- Surgeons must set multiple parameters (suction time, flap, hinge), which increases complexity.  
- Incorrect recommendations may lead to poor outcomes and unnecessary costs.  

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution  
- Develop a **CNN-based deep learning model** to analyze corneal topography.  
- Provide accurate predictions for keratoconus detection.  
- Assist surgeons in **recommending surgery** and help patients make **informed financial decisions**.  

---

## 🔬 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection** – CSV data + corneal image data.  
2. **Model Training** – Two separate models (CSV + image data) and a combined model.  
3. **CNN Architecture** – Extracts and learns features of keratoconus eyes.  
4. **Deployment** – User-friendly interface for clinical use.  

---

## 📊 Results  
- The **KeratoDetect CNN model** achieved **99.33% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
- Strong potential to support ophthalmologists in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 🧪 Pre-Qualification Tests for Surgery  
Before recommending surgery, the following tests are performed:  
- Prescription Check  
- Eye Muscle Test  
- Tear Analysis  
- Cornea Measurements (Topography)  
- Wavefront Analysis  
- Corneal Thickness Measurement  
- Pupil Size Measurement  
- Complete Eye Examination

## ⚔️ Competition & Research  
- Competing studies focus on identifying risk factors (allergy, eye rubbing, asthma, etc.).  
- Our approach uniquely integrates **image-based CNN detection** with **clinical test data**.
